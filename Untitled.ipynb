    "#### Three players A, B, C play the following game. First, A picks a real number between 0 and 1 (both inclusive), then B picks a number in the same range (different from A’s choice) and finally C picks a number, also in the same range, (different from the two chosen numbers). We then pick a number in the range uniformly randomly. Whoever’s number is closest to this random number wins the game. Assume that A, B and C all play optimally and their sole goal is to maximise their chances of winning. Also assume that if one of them has several optimal choices, then that player will randomly pick one of the optimal choices. What number should player A choose to maximize his winning rate?"

    "We divide the interval into evenly distanced fractions, from which player A,B,C will pick their own number. Then we want to create a 3D matrix with each entry storing the winning rates of players given the choice of their numbers. For example, if we divide [0,1] into grids of size 0.01 and A chooses 0.2, B chooses 0.30 and C chooses 0.55, then the Monte-Carlo approximated winning rates of the three players (p_A,p_B,p_C) for their choice will be stores in winning_rates[20][30][55]. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we can think of $f(i,j,k)=$ winning_rates[][][] defines a function --- with the three inputs $(i,j,k)$ denoting the choice of A,B,C in unit of step size (for example if A want to choose 0.2, B 0.3 and C 0.6, and the step size is 0.05, then $(i,j,k)=(4,6,12)$) it outputs the winning rates of the three players for such choice tuple. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since three players are playing optimally, to determine the best strategy for A we need to calculate backwards. C place last and the optimal choice for C given the choice of A and B can be calculated by $$C_{opt}(i,j)=\\mathrm{argmax}_k f(i,j,k)$$ which is a function of $(i,j)$. We store this information in the 2D matrix choice_of_C[][]. And once C determines the number he picks, B would have knowledge of how C would make choices and can make correponding decisions based on the give choice of A and the knowledge of C's choice. With that being said, we will be able to compute $$B_{opt}(i)=\\mathrm{argmax}_j f(i,j,C_{opt}(i,j))$$ given that we know how to compute $C_{opt}$. And the optimal choices for B conditional on each of A's choice will be stored in an array choice_of_B[]. And finally A will have complete knowledge of how B,C would make decision based on his own choice. What's left is just to pick the choice which with the correponding conditional optimal choices of B and C, the probability of winning is maximized. Formally the formula for the optimal location $$A_{opt}=\\mathrm{argmax}_i f(i,B_{opt}(i),C_{opt}(i,B_{opt}(i)))$$"
